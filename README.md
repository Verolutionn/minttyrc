# minttyrc

Custom `.minttyrc` file for *Git Bash*.

You just have to put this file at `$HOME/.minttyrc` to get a nice *Git Bash* terminal with nice settings.

:warning: **Warning**: please make a backup of your existing `.minttyrc` before, if you don't know what you're doing.

In alternative, you can use the following *Bash* command:

```bash
curl -o "$HOME/.minttyrc" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmotte/minttyrc/master/.minttyrc
```
